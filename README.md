# ArduinoDMI
This Arduino-based Digital Musical Instrument (DMI) allows a user to scrub through an audio sample with a handheld gyroscope, controlling reverb or other processing with hand gestures. This was a collaboration with Justin Schwiesow at the University of Washington for a final project in EE 474: Introduction to Embedded Systems.
